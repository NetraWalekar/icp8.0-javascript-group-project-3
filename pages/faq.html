                Is it safe to use my credit/ debit card?

            <div class="text">
                Yes it is absolutely safe to use your card on Naturesbasket.co.in. A recent directive from RBI makes it mandatory to have an additional authentication pass code verified by VISA (VBV) or MSC (Master Secure Code) which has to be entered by online shoppers while paying online using visa or master credit card. It means extra security for customers, thus making online shopping safer.
